# downloady-bois
Little tools that I once made to download stuff from places

note: the one for audiomicro uses [allOrigins](http://allorigins.win) because of cors reasons idk how long it will survive because sometimes services like that die

also note: don't use some of the listers as they spam the server(s) quite a bit
