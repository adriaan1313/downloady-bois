# downloady-bois
Little tools that I once made to download stuff from places

note: the ones for audiomicro/epidemic/nicknl/lalela/omroep brabant use [allOrigins](http://allorigins.win) because of cors reasons idk how long it will survive because sometimes services like that die

also note: don't use some of the listers as they spam the server(s) quite a bit

also also note: if something goes wrong, it won't be nice and alert you of it, it will just throw an error in the console and not work
