# downloady-bois
Little tools that I once made to download stuff from places

note: the ones for audiomicro/epidemic/nicknl/lalela/omroep brabant/omroep west/extrememusic use [allOrigins](http://allorigins.win) because of cors reasons idk how long it will survive because sometimes services like that die. the omroep zeeland ones will too, seeing as made their web-site all fancy and care about cors now and i'll have to update it.
Like they haven't updated their site in years, but now they do??

also note: don't use some of the listers as they spam the server(s) quite a bit

also also note: if something goes wrong, it won't be nice and alert you of it, it will just throw an error in the console and not work
